Keynotes:

- In DOM, the unit is called as Node, like Object. _(From MDN, The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects)_
- Based on Node, there are several notable subclasses: **Document**, **Element**, **Text**, **Comment**...
- Like Java Inherit, the subclasses also could use parent class methods
